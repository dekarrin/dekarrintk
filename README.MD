==========

ActionScript 2.0 command console library.

This project was an attempt to create a command prompt library for use with
Adobe Flash projects. It is an old project, circa 2009, and the times of the
commits to this repo have been altered to respect the original modification
times of the files of the project at the time that they were added.

The library worked at one point, and could be used in ActionScript 2.0 based
projects. It has not been tested for a long time, so whether it still works is
in the air.
